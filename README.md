# Premier League Attendance Analysis

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes **matchday attendance trends** for the Premier League's **Big Six clubs** — Manchester United, Manchester City, Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, and Tottenham Hotspur — over a **70-year period (1949–2019)**.

Using a mix of **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, **multiple regression**, **GLS modeling**, **multicollinearity treatment (PCA)**, and **ARIMA time-series forecasting**, this project examines how factors like ticket prices, stadium capacity, league performance, cup wins, and economic conditions influence fan turnout.

The study also provides **practical insights for clubs and football authorities** to enhance fan engagement and optimize stadium utilization.

- **Modeling Approaches**:
  - **OLS Regression**
  - **Generalized Least Squares (GLS)** for heteroscedasticity correction
  - **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for multicollinearity resolution
  - **ARIMA Forecasting** of attendance and stadium utilization ratios
- **Comparative Analysis**: Club-wise and region-wise trends.
- **Strategic Insights** for fan engagement & stadium optimization.
